Overview:
You will build a graph from a list of words.  In the graph created, each word is a vertex and edges exists between words that differ from each other by one simple transition (as described below).  Once created, you will implement WordProcessor and GraphProcessor that uses a dictionary graph and shortest path algorithm to find the shortest path between two words. 

A GraphTest class is provided to you.  But, you must define a GraphProcessorTest class in addition to the classes needed for your solution.


Learning Outcomes:
Implement generic Graph in Java

Write a program to create a graph of dictionary words

Implement shortest distance path algorithm (Dijkstra's or Floyd-Warshall recommended)

Introduce you to Java's New IO (nio) types

Try Test Driven Development by writing tests in GraphProcessorTest to help develop WordProcessor and GraphProcessor functionality.

Description:
You are given a dictionary of words. You have to implement a graph where the vertices are the words in the dictionary and the edges denote a difference of one character between two vertices. Differences can be any one of the below 3 types:

Substitution of 1 character
Addition of 1 character
Deletion of 1 character
(Note: No duplicate vertices are allowed in the graph.)

In other words, an edge exists between two words if and only if one word can be converted to another with exactly one modification (1 substitution or 1 addition or 1 deletion). Below image shows a diagrammatic representation of graph for a dictionary of 9 words.

For this assignment, you are required to

implement a generic GraphADT interface in the class Graph.
implement the GraphProcessor class which contains method to create a graph from a dictionary file, method to precompute shortest path data structures and methods to quickly calculate shortest distance/path between 2 words, using the precomputed shortest path data structures. 
implement methods of WordProcessor, a utility class which contains methods to read a stream of words from a dictionary file and to check whether two words are adjacent or not. Implementing them will help you streamline the design for GraphProcessor class.
implement GraphProcessorTest class (described next)
By now, you should be familiar with how to write unit tests. Since no main method is provided, you'll need to test your implementation via the Junit  classes. GraphTest.java is provided to you which tests all the common use-cases for Graph.java. You are welcome to add more tests to GraphTest.java to cover any remaining use-cases.  You must write one JUnit unit test class - GraphProcessorTest.java - to test the public methods of GraphProcessor. 

Go through the source code and the comments to get detailed information for each class.

All files must be named correctly (case-sensitive). You may define and submit other package level (not public or private) classes as needed and you may add private members and methods to your classes. 

Java8 Stream<T>
class WordProcessor has a public static method, getWordStream() which returns a java.util.stream.Stream object (check the code for more details).

Streams were introduced in Java8 to adopt functional programming concepts that help reduce the complexity of the code and make it more intuitive. Even though the names are similar, Java 8 streams are completely different from InputStream and OutputStream from Java I/O.

 java.util.stream.Stream represents a sequence of elements on which one or more operations can be performed. There are intermediate and terminal stream operations. While terminal operations return a result of a certain type, intermediate operations return the stream itself so you can chain multiple method calls in a row.

Intermediate stream operations are lazy. This means that they will be invoked only if it is necessary for the terminal operation execution.

Stream operations can either be executed in sequential or parallel execution mode. In the assignment, you should use the sequential execution.

A wide variety of stream operations are available. We have added comments to help you use these three for this assignment:

filter
map
collect

Files
Note: updates to these files are possible, and will be posted in announcements on this page. p4.zip contains the following files:

GraphADT.java (provided interface - do NOT EDIT)
word_list.txt - a file with words for your program to read
few_interesting_combos.txt - the results you can expect for some word pairs given the above word_list.txt file as input.
Do EDIT and SUBMIT the following:

Graph.java (starter class - do EDIT and SUBMIT) 
GraphTest.java (Junit class - may EDIT and do SUBMIT - covers common testcases)
WordProcessor.java  (starter class - do EDIT and SUBMIT - define utility methods for preprocessing)
GraphProcessor.java  (starter class - do EDIT and SUBMIT - define operations to be performed on a graph with String vertices here)
GraphProcessorTest.java (Junit class - must CREATE and SUBMIT - define testcases for GraphProcessor).  
Test-Driven Development - try writing the tests first and then write the code to pass the tests.  Be sure to submit any data (txt) files required by your test classes.

Steps
Read entire assignment.
Review grading rubric. Note: the rubric is subject to some changes.
You may use the Java development environment of your choice. However, all programs must compile and run using JUnit4 and Java 8 from the Linux workstations in the lab computers for grading. If you are going to use the CS lab computers, we recommend that you use Eclipse. You may want to review the Eclipse tutorial to learn the basics. Note that on the Linux lab computers, you should enter "eclipse&" at the prompt instead of what is described in the tutorial.
Create a p4 project for your team's work.  
Create and use a GitHub repository to support multiple programmer submissions by your team members.
Copy the provided source files into your project folder and refresh.
Add JUnit 4 library to your project. (See p2)
Add return stub return statements to any methods that don't compile.
Test-Driven Development 
Work on one test at a time
run GraphTest (likely will fail)
add code to Graph class to pass the test
check that previous tests still pass
Repeat by adding code and getting all tests to pass
Add tests if you notice problem with your graph class that is not being tested yet. 
Reminder: If you are not using the lab computers to develop your program, make sure that you compile and run your program to ensure that it works on the Linux lab computers.
Submit Work to:
 X-Team Exercise #4
After submitting your files, check the contents of the files of your last submission on Canvas.  This is because occasionally students have submitted old or unimplemented source files (because they have multiple backup copies on their computer).   You may need to download the files from your Canvas account and open them to see if they actually have the correct code contents.
